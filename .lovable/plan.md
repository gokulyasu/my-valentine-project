# 💖 Valentine's Proposal Website for Janani

A cute, playful, and deeply romantic 4-page interactive website with fun animations, emoji-filled design, and a mix of English & Tamil.

---

## Page 1 – The Proposal 💍
- Beautiful animated landing page with floating hearts and sparkle effects
- Main heading: *"Janani… if love had a destiny, it led me to you."*
- Tamil touch: *"En vazhkaiyil vandha azhagana varam nee than"*
- Subtext: *"So tell me… will you be my Valentine? ❤️"*
- Two buttons: **Yes** and **No**
- **No button:** Every click triggers a random funny popup from the list (English + Tamil mix), and the No button bounces/moves away playfully
- **Yes button:** Celebration animation with confetti burst and the message: *"And just like that… my favorite girl officially became my Valentine 💕"*
- After Yes, a "Continue" button appears to go to the next page

## Page 2 – The Love Letter 💌
- Intro: *"This isn't just a letter… it's my heart speaking."*
- The full English love letter displayed in an elegant, scroll-reveal style (lines appear gently as you scroll)
- Tamil excerpts woven in as accent quotes between sections
- Signed off: *"Forever yours, Gokul ❤️"*
- Closing caption: *"If my life is a movie… you are the plot twist I prayed for."*
- Cute animated envelope or letter-opening effect at the top

## Page 3 – Songs / Soundtrack 🎵
- Top caption: *"Some love stories are written… ours has a soundtrack 🎵❤️"*
- Spotify embeds for songs (you can share Spotify track links and I'll embed them — we'll start with placeholder embeds)
- When hovering/playing: *"This isn't just a song… it's how my heart sounds when I think of you."*
- Playful music note animations floating in the background

## Page 4 – Memories / Photos 📸
- Top heading: *"Not just pictures… pieces of my happiest moments."*
- Photo gallery with placeholder images (you can swap in real photos later)
- Each photo card has a subtle hover animation
- Bottom caption: *"Every memory has you. Every future will too."*
- Cute polaroid or scrapbook-style layout
